## 👋 Hi there, I'm **Yaoyao Qian (Freax Ruby)** ✨
🏠 [**My Homepage**](https://freaxhomepage.vercel.app/) (🚧 Currently Under Construction)

As I gear up for my second year at **Northeastern University**, I reflect on my incredible journey so far. One of the standout moments was my **Machine Learning Engineer Co-op** experience at **Lendbuzz**, where I integrated **vLLM** into systems, achieving a **175% inference speedup**. 🚀  

I'm currently immersed in exciting **robotics and AI research** at:  
- 🤖 [**The Helping Hands Lab**](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/) under **Dr. Robert Platt**, advancing **robotic grasping and manipulation systems**.  
- 🧶 [**Information Experience and Accessibility Lab**](http://rachelfadler.com) at **UIUC** with **Dr. Rachel F. Adler**, enhancing **fintech** and **mHealth accessibility** for older adults.

## About Me  

Before starting my graduate studies at **Northeastern University**, my academic and professional journey centered around full-stack development while also exploring diverse areas of research and technology. During my **undergraduate years**, my coursework focused heavily on **full-stack development**, and I applied these skills to projects at **Wenzhou University of Technology**, **Wenzhou Bopu Institute of Big Data**, and **MIE DEMO Studio**. Notable achievements included **public opinion analysis**, **data-driven research**, and developing a **volunteer management platform**, which was recognized as a **national innovation project**.  

After graduation, I worked as a **Technical Manager** and **Project Leader** at **Zhejiang Chongxiao Zhong Han Medical Technology Co.**, where I led full-stack development projects. Key contributions included creating a **VC++-based database integration tool** and a **Springboot+Vue electronic invoice management system**, achieving an **80% improvement in operational efficiency**.  

Alongside my primary focus on full-stack development, I also explored other areas such as **sentiment analysis**, **knowledge graph construction**, and **user behavior modeling**, broadening my technical expertise and research interests.  

In the early phase of my graduate studies, I joined the **CHATS Lab** at Northeastern University, where I worked on **chatbot-related projects**, contributing to advancements in conversational AI systems.
